# CERN - Introduction to Python for Programmers

## Aim:

The aim of this course is to allow scientists, engineers and others who have programming experience become confident in reading, writing and working with code in Python.

We'll start with syntax, data types and flow control and finish with working with files, threads and processes. 

Each section will be accompanied with slides, sample code, a lab and solutions. 

As a live course, we can go deeper on topics that are of interest, whether or not they are on the syllabus or not.
